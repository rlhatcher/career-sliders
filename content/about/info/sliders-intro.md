## What is a career slider?

A **Career Slider** is a graphical representation of a set of individual **behaviours** relating to a common theme.

These Career Sliders are not based on an exhaustive list of professional behaviours – just the most common ones I’ve come across, and the ones most easily represented in this form.

Career Sliders are relevant to people on the **individual contributor track** or on the **management track**. They are helpful to both individuals and to managers looking to help their team members understand their strengths and where they need to grow.

Career Sliders are also **industry-agnostic**.

## What does it represent?

![blank career slider](../blank-slider.svg)

Career Sliders represent a set of demonstrated and expected behaviours, with the least desirable behaviour to the left of the slider and the most desirable to the right. Individuals should generally be pushing themselves consistently as far to the right as possible regardless of their role or level, but there will probably be minimum behavioural expectations for certain roles and levels.

Individuals probably **won’t fit neatly on the slider** in one section. It is likely they will exhibit more than one behaviour for a particular theme. The goal is not to score or place an individual on a slider. The goal is to use the Sliders **as a tool to frame a conversation** around current exhibited behaviours, expected behaviours and explore the variance between the individual's **self-perception** and the **perception of others**.

## How should I use them?

There is no pre-defined process for how you should use Career Sliders. The value they bring to you will depend on your circumstances.

You may find it valuable to go through the process, either as an individual or as a manager, of performing a self-evaluation for every Career Slider and discussing the variance.

You may find it useful to use one particular career slider to set expectations with a team member.

You may find it useful to set yourself behavioural targets using the Career Sliders.

Use them in whatever way you find useful.
