## Welcome to **Career Sliders**!

In most organisations, it's common to have conversations around **what** is expected of an individual in relation to their role. We often use **goal-setting** as a way of structuring these conversations. The bigger challenge is finding ways of framing conversations about **how** goals are being achieved and **how** individuals are conducting themselves in their general day-to-day activities.

In some organisations, the **how** even forms part of the performance review process, but often there is little guidance for individuals on what is expected of them behaviourally, and even less guidance for managers on how to have these conversations successfully.

After several years of having unstructured conversations with team members about the **how**, I increasingly found that:

1. Conversations tended to centre around certain behavioural themes
1. Graphical representations made the conversations more successful

{{< icon name="lightbulb" pack="fas" >}} And so the idea of representing these behavioural themes as a series of **Career Sliders** was born.

{{< icon name="eye" pack="fas" >}} See [**Sliders Introduction**](../../about/info/sliders-intro/) for more information about what Career Sliders are and [**Guidance for Individuals**](../../about/info/individuals/) and [**Guidance for Managers**](../../about/info/managers/) to find out about the scenarios in which **Career Sliders** can be useful.

Once you understand what the Sliders are and how you can use them, take a look at the [**Sliders**](../../sliders/info/).
