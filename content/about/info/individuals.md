_On this page you will find some examples of how you might use the Career Sliders as an **individual**. These are just examples and not an exhaustive list. Use the Sliders however you find them useful. There are no rules!_

## To identify strengths and areas for growth

You can use the Career Sliders proactively to self-evaluate your behaviour relating to the themes. Regardless of your role or level, the more you can consistently push yourself over to the right, the better.

From this exercise, you can identify some areas of strength that you might want to develop further and some areas of development where you might want to focus your growth efforts.

If, during the exercise, you're unclear as to what's expected of you in your role, use the Career Sliders to get a better understanding from your manager.

## To clarify a difficult feedback conversation

You know the situation. Your manager calls you in for an unexpected 1:1 and wants to talk to you about your behaviour. During the meeting, your manager gives you some feedback and suggests that you need to "get better at dealing with change", or "deal with feedback better". You come out of the meeting dumb-founded and somewhat confused about what to do with the feedback.

You can use the Career Sliders proactively with your manager and ask them to help you understand where they think you currently are in relation to a particular behavioural area and clarify what their expectations of you are.

## To help understand how to get to the next level on your career journey

You know you want to progress to the next level at your organisation - whether that be on the individual contributor or the management track. You've had a conversation with your manager and agreed some specific goals you should achieve in order to be considered for that promotion or career switch, but you know there's more to it than achieving tasks. Behaviourally, something more or something different is also likely to be expected of you as you change roles or progress up the career track. Understanding what those expectations are can be challenging.

You can use the Career Sliders in conversations with your manager and others to understand what's expected behaviourally in the role you'd like to be doing; identify where you're currently at, and therefore understand the behavioural changes you want to focus on.

## As a tool to get feedback from others

The Career Sliders can be used as a tool to ask for focused feedback from others. You can ask them to provide you with feedback (directly or anonymously) on where they think you are on the Sliders and why, and use this feedback to identify your strengths and growth areas.
