_On this page you will find some examples of how you might use the Career Sliders as an **individual**. These are just examples and not an exhaustive list. Use the sliders however you find them useful. There are no rules!_

## To identify strengths and areas for growth

You can use the Career Sliders proactively as a general individual assessment of where you think you're currently at behaviourally, with the knowledge that, regardless of your role or level, the more you can consistently push yourself over to the right, the better.

From this exercise, you can identify some strength areas that you might want to elevate even further and some areas where you might want to focus your growth.

If, during the exercise, you're unclear what is expected of you in your role at your organisation, use the Career Sliders to get a better understanding from your manager what those expectations are.

## To clarify a difficult feedback conversation

You know the situation. Your manager calls you in for an unexpected 1:1 and wants to talk to you about your behaviour. During the meeting, your manager provides you with some feedback and suggests that you need to "get better at dealing with change", or "deal with feedback better". You come out of the meeting dumb-founded and more than a little confused about what to do with that feedback. 

You can use the Career Sliders proactively with your manager and ask them to help you understand where they think you are currently in relation to a particular slider and what their expectations are of you. 

## To help understand how to get to the next level on your career journey

You know you want to progress to the next level at your organisation - whether that be on the individual contributor or management track. You've had a conversation with your manager and agreed some specific goals that you're expected to achieve in order to be considered for that promotion or career switch, but you know there's more to it than achieving tasks. Behaviourally, more/something different is likely to be expected of you as you change roles or progress up the career track. Understanding what those expectations are can be challenging.

You can use the Career Sliders in conversations with your manager and others to understand what is expected behaviourally in the role you'd like to be doing; identify where you're currently at, and, therefore, understand the behavioural changes you want to focus on.

## As a tool to get feedback from others

The Career Sliders can be used as a tool to ask for focused feedback from others. You can ask others to provide you with feedback (directly or anonymously) on where they think you are on the sliders and use this feedback to identify strengths and growth areas.
