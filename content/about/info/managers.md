_On this page you will find some examples of how you might use the Career Sliders as a **manager**. These are just examples and not an exhaustive list. Use the sliders however you find them useful. There are no rules!_

## As part of a formal performance management framework

Oftentimes, annual performance reviews centre around performance goals - i.e. the **what** an individual achieves. But we all know there is more to being a high performer than purely **what** an individual achieves and that, actually, **how** an individual achieves their goals and approaches their day-to-day activities can be just as important.

Sometimes the **how** also forms part of the performance review process, but it can be challenging for managers to understand how to assess individuals in a transparent, fair and consistent fashion. This is where Career Sliders can help.

Regardless of whether performance reviews at your organisation include assessing **how** an individual goes about achieving their goals or not, if you don't already have a framework in place for doing so, Career Sliders can be used to help you frame conversations over the year relating to the **how** and also used as part of a formal performance review.

## To deliver difficult feedback

Having difficult feedback conversations with your team members is one of the hardest aspects of being a manager. It's a tough but necessary evil if you care about the growth and development of your team and the individuals within it. Having these conversations unstructured is even harder and here's where Career Sliders can come in handy.

You can use the Career Sliders - any number of them, or just one - to help team members visualise and understand where they are at currently and where you expect them to be.

## To set expectations for an individual

Career sliders can be used to frame conversations around minimum behaviour expectations for a particular role or level. This may be helpful for newcomers joining your team, or for an individual who wants to switch to a different role or get promoted.

## To set expectations across an organisation

You may wish to formalise Career Sliders and set expectations across your organisation. It may be helpful in doing so to align the Career Sliders also to your company values.

Below is an example of how you might do this. Minimum expectations will vary from organisation to organisation and you should set these to whatever makes sense for you in your team, your department, or your organisation.

These, for example, would be my minimum expectations of engineers in my team. To give you some sense of levelling, a T6 would be equivalent to a Senior Software Engineer.
