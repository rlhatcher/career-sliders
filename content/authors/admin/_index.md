Hello, I'm Natalie.

Professionally, I've been managing people and leading teams in the technology sector for over ten years after starting out my career as a software tester - a discipline I remain passionate about.

More recently my focus has switched towards managing managers. Helping ordinary managers become awesome managers is where my real passion lies.

I live in a town called Canterbury in the South East of England in the UK where I share a home with my husband and son.

Becoming a mother has been both the most rewarding and the most challenging experience of my life. Juggling parenthood with full-time work is a balancing act I'm still working on, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

I created Career Sliders as a way of visualising a range of professional behaviours within common themes. The aim is to help individuals to grow and to help managers frame conversations about behavioural growth.

I hope you find them useful.
