## Detach From It

Demonstrated by not engaging with conflict resolution and/or solely identifying the actions of others that contributed to a conflict. Individuals who detach from conflict resolution tend not to reflect on their own actions in relation to a conflict.

## Escalate It

Demonstrated by escalating a conflict to a manager/leader for them to resolve. Individuals who escalate conflict tend not to seek out ways to manage conflict independently.

## Collaborative Co-operation

Demonstrated by proactively working with others to resolve a conflict. These individuals think about their own actions and the actions of others to try to find a positive path forward from the conflict.

## Self Reflection

Demonstrated by reflecting on their own actions to resolve a conflict and avoid future conflicts. Individuals who self-reflect during or following a conflict proactively find ways to learn from the situation, adjust their behaviour, and apply the learning in the future.
