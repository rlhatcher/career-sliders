## Governed

Demonstrated by simply responding to instructions from others without understanding the problem or need or making efforts to. Individuals who are displaying governed-like behaviours are likely to also be disengaged.

## Mostly Tactical

Demonstrated by thinking/actions that respond to an immediate problem or need. Individuals who are thinking/acting mostly tactically may find they are often too busy putting out fires to investigate the cause of the fires.

## Tactical & Strategic

Demonstrated by displaying a balance between tactical and strategic thinking/actions. Individuals in management or leadership roles (including those on the individual contributor track) should expect to be thinking and acting at least somewhat strategically. In general, the wider your sphere of influence, the more strategically you should think and act.

## Mostly Strategic

Demonstrated by longer term thinking/actions that allow teams, departments and organisations to plan and deal with problems/needs carefully and proactively. Individuals with a wide sphere of influence should be primarily thinking and acting strategically and over a longer horizon.
