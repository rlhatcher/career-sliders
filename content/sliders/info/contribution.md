## Disengaged

Demonstrated by disengaging from contributing to individual or team tasks or activities. An individual being disengaged in contributing represents a serious behavioural issue that requires further investigation.

## Supported

Demonstrated by contributing to tasks/activities with the support of others. Individuals at the beginning of their career or in a new role can expect to be supported in the completion of tasks and activities but this should always be a transient state.

## Independent

Demonstrated by contributing to tasks/activities with limited or no support from others. Individuals who are largely independent may also display supported or supporter behaviours depending on the circumstances.

## Supporter

Demonstrated by supporting others to contribute to tasks/activities. Individuals who largely support others will likely also contribute independently to tasks/activities depending on the circumstances.
