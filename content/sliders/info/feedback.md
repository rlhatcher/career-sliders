## Avoid It

Demonstrated by avoiding situations in which feedback may be given or received. Individuals who avoid feedback tend to find receiving unsolicited feedback particularly challenging.

## Excuse It

Demonstrated by receiving feedback but not taking personal responsibility for it. Individuals who excuse feedback tend to justify their behaviour based on circumstances or the behaviour of others.

## Seek It

Demonstrated by proactively seeking feedback from others (but not necessarily proactively acting on it). Individuals who seek feedback tend to react well when receiving feedback and proaactively search for opportunities to receive it.

## Embrace It

Demonstrated by proactively seeking feedback from others at every opportunity and acting on it. Individuals who embrace feedback tend to react well when receiving feedback and proactively dig deeper to understand how they can improve.
