## Resist It

Demonstrated by a lack of ownership of individual or team tasks and/or by actively avoiding ownership when asked or expected. Individuals operating at this level are likely also disengaged.

## Deflect It

Demonstrated by making excuses for lack of ownership and/or looking to other people to own a task instead of taking responsibility themselves. Individuals operating at this level may also claim ownership for an activity or task despite seeking others to take ownership.

## Comply With It

Demonstrated by reluctantly complying with instructions to own a task. Individuals operating at this level will take ownership of a task when asked to do so but often don't take an activity or task across the line. Complying individuals will also rarely seek opportunities to take ownership of activities or tasks which are otherwise unowned.

## Own It

Demonstrated by owning a task in its entirety and actively seeking opportunities for ownership. Individuals operating at this level will often identify an activity or task that doesn't have a clear owner, take it on and drive it through to successful completion.
