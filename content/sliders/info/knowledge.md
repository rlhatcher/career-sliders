## Neglect It

Demonstrated by seeking others to provide instructions/answers/solutions without first trying to learn a particular area. Individuals who neglect knowledge are often expect problems to be solved by others.

## Learn It

Demonstrated by learning what is necessary to perform a role â€“ either self-directed or from others. Individuals who demonstrate learning without mastering are often more junior in their career but, again, this should be a transient state before moving on to mastering.

## Master It

Demonstrated by becoming an expert in a particular area and/or learning what might be necessary to solve a future problem/need. Individuals who are more senior in their careers are expected to master a particular domain or skill, although they may still be learning other domains or skills.

## Teach It

Demonstrated by teaching skills and expertise that has been mastered to others. Individuals may display behaviours of teaching skills and/or expertise whilst also mastering and/or learning others.
