## Neglect It

Demonstrated by asking others to provide instructions, answers or solutions without first trying to learn for themselves. Individuals who neglect knowledge often expect problems to be solved by others.

## Learn It

Demonstrated by learning what is necessary to perform a role â€“ either self-directed or from others. Individuals who demonstrate learning without mastering are often more junior in their career but this should be a temporary state before moving on to mastering.

## Master It

Demonstrated by becoming an expert in a particular area and/or learning what might be necessary to solve a future problem/need. Individuals who are more senior in their careers are expected to master a particular domain or skill, although they may still be learning other domains or skills.

## Teach It

Demonstrated by teaching the skills and expertise they have mastered to other people. Individuals may display behaviours of teaching skills and/or expertise while also mastering and/or learning others.
